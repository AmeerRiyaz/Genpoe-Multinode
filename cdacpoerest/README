Installation of bcrypt for admin.py
To install bcrypt, simply:

$ pip install bcrypt
Note that bcrypt should build very easily on Linux provided you have a C compiler, headers for Python (if youâ€™re not using pypy), and headers for the libffi libraries available on your system.

For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python-dev
For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

$ sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel
